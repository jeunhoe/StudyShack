        \n\n2. Study Sessions:
        \nYou can clock your study session in your specific house.
        \nAfter clocking enough time in that house, you can even upgrade them!</string>
    <string name="second_info">Note:
        \nIf you leave the app or stop the timer halfway, all recorded progress for that session so far will not be recorded!
